# Hello-World
My Hello-World to Github.
Hi there. It`s JimmyWUz from China. Actually, I`m completely a newbie in the Github community. And I`m making my first step to the magic field of programming. I come here not for my profession(perhaps it will be), but for my dream of being a terrific programmer though I was just assigned to the profession of Business Administration in SCUT after Gaokao, the college-entrance examination in China. What turn out to be the most interesting one is that my profession seems have nothing to do with programming. Anyway, I won`t stop because I believe that I`ll reach far in this field after numerous times of trial and error. Good luck to myself.
